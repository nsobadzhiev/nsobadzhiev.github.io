Hello guys,

Iâ€™m so glad you took the time to visit this website. This is my personal little space on the internet, where I go about writing about strange stuff I encounter in my daily programming experience. I use it mainly to talk about problems, nobody around me cares to listen to, so that I am able to somehow express my thoughts in hopes that someday, someone will read them and maybe even benefit from them.

Thank you for reading! You are awesome!
